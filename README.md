## Personal Portfolio Website

I created this personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and learning journey as a Computer Science student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

I am currently focused on front-end development, using this project as a practice space to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I plan to keep updating this repository as I learn new concepts and technologies.

* CSS3 (custom styling)
* JavaScript
